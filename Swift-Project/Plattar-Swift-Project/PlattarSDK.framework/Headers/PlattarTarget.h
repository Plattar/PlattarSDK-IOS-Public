/**
 * Returns Pose information about the current tracker. These values are updated
 * on a set timer defined by the Plattar System. It is advised to register and listen
 * to the appropriate callback which will be called repeatedly. 
 *
 * The POSE information is used by the Plattar renderer to position and display 3D content
 * properly. It can also be used for an external renderer (such as openGL ES/Metal etc..) to
 * do your own rendering.
 *
 * Contains Helper functions via xxxFill() methods which allows adding the internal matrix data
 * into a dictionary (as an array) for easy serialization or transfer over a network.
